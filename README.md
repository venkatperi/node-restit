*curl++ for RESTful APIs*

## Overview

[restcli](https://github.com/venkatperi/node-restcli) is a [command line tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for talking to RESTful APIs. It's intended to reduce some of the repetition and verbosity that comes with using general purpose CLI tools such as [curl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) with RESTful APIs.

`restcli` requires `npm`, the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org).

## Install

    [sudo] npm install restcli -g
